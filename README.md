# PPR-iRacing-Results-Reader
To use:
Export a results file from iRacing, rename to `results.json` and put it in the app directory.
Check the results on iRacing and see how many drivers there are (with at least 1 clean lap set, as a missing lap throws an error for now). Enter that number into the input prompt.
The resulting file will be called `results.csv`.
