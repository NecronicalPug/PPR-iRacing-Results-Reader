# PPR-iRacing-Results-Reader
To use:
Export a results file from iRacing, rename to `results.json` and put it in the app directory.
Check the results on iRacing and see how many drivers there are (with at least 1 clean lap set, as a missing lap throws an error for now). Enter that number into the input prompt.
The resulting file will be called `results.csv`.


Free to use for anything so long as you don't claim this as your own and only your own. :P
For any enquiries, create an issue on the repo, thanks!
